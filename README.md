# Question: How do you implement a cache with a TTL (time to live) per key? C# Summary

The provided C# code implements a cache with a time-to-live (TTL) for each key-value pair. The cache is implemented as a concurrent dictionary, which allows for thread-safe operations. When a key-value pair is added to the cache, it is wrapped in a CacheItem object. This object includes a timer that is set to the specified TTL. When the timer expires, it triggers an action that removes the key-value pair from the cache. If an attempt is made to add a key that already exists in the cache, the existing key's timer is cancelled before the new key-value pair is added. This ensures that each key in the cache has only one active TTL. When retrieving a value from the cache using a key, the program checks if the key exists in the cache. If it does, the associated value is returned. If it doesn't, an exception is thrown indicating that no item with the provided key was found in the cache. This approach effectively implements a cache with a TTL for each key-value pair.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution uses a similar approach to the C# version, but there are some differences due to the language features and built-in modules available in Python.

1. Data Structures: Both versions use a dictionary-like data structure to store the cache items. In C#, a `ConcurrentDictionary` is used, which is a thread-safe collection of key-value pairs. In Python, a standard dictionary is used, which is not inherently thread-safe, but the `threading` module is used to handle concurrency.

2. Threading and Timers: Both versions use timers to implement the TTL functionality. In C#, a `Timer` object is used, which calls a specified callback method after a certain interval. In Python, a `threading.Timer` object is used, which starts a new thread after a certain interval and calls a specified function.

3. Exception Handling: In the C# version, if a key is not found in the cache, an `ArgumentException` is thrown. In the Python version, if a key is not found in the cache, `None` is returned. This is a difference in the error handling approach between the two versions.

4. Encapsulation: In the C# version, the cache item and its TTL are encapsulated in a `CacheItem` class, and the timer is managed within this class. In the Python version, the cache item and its TTL are stored in separate dictionaries, and the timer is managed in the `set` method of the `Cache` class.

5. Type Safety: C# is a statically typed language, so the types of the keys and values in the cache are specified when the `Cache` class is instantiated. Python is dynamically typed, so any type of object can be used as a key or value in the cache.

# Java Differences

The Java and C# versions of the solution are similar in their overall approach to the problem, but they differ in some language-specific features and methods.

In the C# version, a `ConcurrentDictionary` is used to store the cache items, and each cache item is an instance of a `CacheItem` class that includes a `Timer` to handle the TTL. When the TTL expires, the `Timer` triggers an action that removes the item from the cache. If an item is added to the cache with a key that already exists, the existing item's `Timer` is cancelled before the new item is added.

In the Java version, two `ConcurrentHashMap` instances are used: one for the cache items and another for the expiry times. A `ScheduledExecutorService` is used to schedule a task that runs every second and checks the expiry times of all items in the cache, removing any that have expired. When an item is added to the cache, its expiry time is calculated and stored in the `expiryMap`.

The C# version uses a `Timer` within each cache item to handle the TTL, while the Java version uses a `ScheduledExecutorService` to periodically check all items in the cache. The C# version cancels the `Timer` of an existing item if a new item with the same key is added, while the Java version simply overwrites the existing item and its expiry time.

The C# version throws an exception if an attempt is made to access a key that is not in the cache, while the Java version returns `null` in this case. This is a difference in how the two languages typically handle such situations.

In terms of language features, the C# version uses properties and lambda expressions, which are features of C#. The Java version uses lambda expressions as well, which were introduced in Java 8. Both versions make use of concurrent collections to ensure thread safety.
